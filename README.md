# Advent of Code 2019

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is a 25-day programming challenge in December. This repository contains solutions. Each user is given a unique input. My inputs are hard-coded into these puzzle solutions (and the test code). In many cases I have done some preprocessing of the puzzle input in a text editor before putting it into the code (e.g. turning a text file of 0s and 1s into a slice of `bool`).

The `intcode` package contains an [`Intcode`](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/2) interpreter, which is used by many of the puzzles.
